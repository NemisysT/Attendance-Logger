---
## Overview
The **eSSL Attendance Data Reader** is a lightweight Python script for parsing and processing `.dat` files generated by eSSL attendance machines. This tool is designed to process attendance data for individual months efficiently and generates a structured Excel output.

## Features
- **File Parsing**: Reads `.dat` files from eSSL attendance systems.
- **Monthly Optimization**: Processes attendance data for specific months.
- **Excel Output**: Generates well-formatted Excel files using `openpyxl` with styled headers and data.
- **User Interaction**: Utilizes a simple GUI for file selection and configuration via `tkinter`.

## Dependencies
This script uses the following libraries:
- `openpyxl`
- `tkinter`
- `datetime`
- `calendar`
- `logging`

No external dependencies or `requirements.txt` file is needed if you already have these libraries available in your Python installation.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python essl_attendance_reader.py
   ```
2. Follow the GUI prompts to:
   - Select the `.dat` file using a file dialog.
   - Specify the month you want to process.

3. Once processing is complete:
   - The script generates an Excel file with attendance data formatted for easy readability.

## Key Features in Output
- **Styled Headers**: Bold fonts, aligned text, and color-coded cells.
- **Date Calculations**: Handles month-specific logic with the `datetime` and `calendar` libraries.
- **Excel Styling**: Borders, column width adjustments, and other formatting for clarity.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Simple GUI elements for input selection.

## How It Works
1. **File Selection**: Prompts the user to select a `.dat` file via a dialog.
2. **Holiday Input**: Asks for the holidays to process.
3. **Data Processing**: Reads the `.dat` file and extracts attendance information.
4. **Excel Export**: Creates a styled Excel file for the selected month.

## Example
- Select a `.dat` file containing raw attendance data.
- Enter "1,2" for the holidays, (days seperated by comma) when prompted.
- The script will generate an output like `attendance_november.xlsx` in the same directory as the script.

## Logging
The script uses Python's `logging` module for debugging and error tracking. Logs are stored in the console for easy troubleshooting.
